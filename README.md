# FETCH EXAMPLE WITH REACT

This example uses the random user API to fetch a users name and displays it in the page.
The fetch call is inside a setTimeout function only to give the example time to show the loader.

App.js = Our app. Handles state.
GetUser.js = Fetch function
ShowUser.js = Need user data to show user name sent as props.
Loader.js = A loader placeholder to show until data is ready
